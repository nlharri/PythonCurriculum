# The Python Curriculum

From this document you can learn the basics of Python programming language. This description is basically for developers. If you haven't wrote any program in any programming language, this document can also be useful, but in order to learn the basics of programming in general, I would suggest looking for other resources as well. Python is a very good programming language for absolute beginners. But the purpose of this document is not to teach you programming in general. Basically it is good to learn these documents if you already have some experience in programming.

On the Internet there are plenty of resources to learn Python programming. In this document you can learn the basics of Python programming step-by-step, from the simple topics towards the more complicated ones. Many useful examples and applications will help you to understand the many use cases of the programming language
