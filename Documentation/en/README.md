# The Python Curriculum

From this document you can learn the basics of Python programming language. This description is basically for developers. If you haven't wrote any program in any programming language, this document can also be useful, but in order to learn the basics of programming in general, I would suggest looking for other resources as well. Python is a very good programming language for absolute beginners. But the purpose of this document is not to teach you programming in general. Basically it is good to learn these documents if you already have some experience in programming.

On the Internet there are plenty of resources to learn Python programming. In this document you can learn the basics of Python programming step-by-step, from the simple topics towards the more complicated ones. Many useful examples and applications will help you to understand the many use cases of the programming language.

### Using Python for automation

In this chapter you can learn how Python can be used practically for repetitive tasks which would take hours to do manually. As a basis of this chapter I used the following book: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

### Using Python for systematically processing websites (webscraping). The BeautifulSoup library

As a basis of this chapter I used the following tutorial: [Tutorial: Python Web Scraping Using BeautifulSoup (by DataQuest)](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/)

### Using Python for network programming

### Building User Interfaces with Python: Tkinter, Kivy, PySide2

In this chapter you will learn how to build desktop applications with the help of three Python libraries.

#### Tkinter basics

#### Kivy basics

#### PySide2 basics

### Using Python for web development. Django and Flask

#### Django basics

#### Flask basics

### Using Python for image processing. The OpenCV library (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

In this chapter you will learn the basics of image processing by using the popular OpenCV library.

As a basis of this chapter I used the following wesite:  [OpenCV Tutorial: A Guide to Learn OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/19/opencv-tutorial-a-guide-to-learn-opencv/)

### Using Python for Data Science

In this chapter you will learn the usage possibilities of Python in the world of scientific computing.
